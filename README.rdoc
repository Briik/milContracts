This app, currently not deployed, is a two-componenet app with an Angular front-end application drawing JSON from a Rails server.

The Rails server populates (rake db:seed) by drawing up to 1000 (may be set to more for deployment) results from a US DoD RSS feed. The data is parsed and compiled into a Postgres (SQL) database for storage.  Using the Whenever gem, the rails app also retrieves information daily at 6:30pm, after the newest DoD data is released (6pm), and adds new records to the database.

The front end is Angular based, with jQuery and Chart.js integration. To allow for proper manipulation of on-screen data a couple of Angular modules are used: $resource for API call to the Rails app, $timeout to delay jQuery and Chart.js until data is loaded, and $filter for correct display of numerical data in human-readable format.  Also used: $ui.router, $stateParams, and $stateProvider.

Style:  At this moment, no effort has been put into styling the app beyond the chart functionality.
